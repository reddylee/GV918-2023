# Week08: Demo 2

## Database

- In this example, we use JHU data on covid cases/death in US Counties
- The database contains only a data in September 2020
- Database is normalized
  - tables for county and state
- Also, other tables exist
  - `demography` 
  - `election_2016`

```{python}
!wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/wkhjoah228gmhtl/covid.sqlite?dl=1 -O covid.sqlite
```

## Import packages

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
```

## Create a connection object

```{python}
con_cov = sqlite3.connect('covid.sqlite')
```

## Check tables

- In sqlite databases, there is a special table called `sqlite_master`. This table contains the information about tables.

```{python}
df_tab_info = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'", con_cov)
df_tab_info
```

- To check the definitions of fields in thetable, we can use `sql` field in the dataframe

```{python}
df_tab_info['sql'][0]
```

- Now let's run a simple query on `covid` table 

```{python}
pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM covid LIMIT 5", con_cov)
```

- What about other tables?

```{python}
pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM county LIMIT 5", con_cov)
```

```{python}
pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM state LIMIT 5", con_cov)
```

### Using `JOIN`

- Combine covid and county

```{python}
pd.read_sql_query("SELECT covid.*, county.county, county.state_code FROM covid INNER JOIN county ON covid.fips = county.fips", con_cov)
```

```{python}
pd.read_sql_query("SELECT a.*, b.county, b.state_code FROM covid AS a INNER JOIN county AS b ON a.fips = b.fips", con_cov)
```

- Combine covid, county, and state

```{python}
pd.read_sql_query("SELECT a.*, b.county, b.state_code, c.state FROM covid AS a INNER JOIN county AS b ON a.fips = b.fips INNER JOIN state as c ON b.state_code = c.state_code", con_cov)
```
