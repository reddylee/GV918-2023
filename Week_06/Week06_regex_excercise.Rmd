# Regex exercise

We use the following dataset from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/reddit-vaccine-myths

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import re
```

```{python}
df_myth = pd.read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/oooz8vktzyimlr0b0mkcn/reddit_vm_sub.csv?rlkey=for1fq6uxuw6h5qttrrvxu8gm&dl=1")
```

Answer following questions using regex:

1. How many comments include a word autisum?

```{python}
pattern = r'autism'
count = sum(1 for comment in df_myth['body'] if re.search(pattern, comment, flags=re.IGNORECASE))

df_myth['body'].str.contains(r'autism',case=False).sum()
```
