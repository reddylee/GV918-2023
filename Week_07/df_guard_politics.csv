3,‘The eyes tracking me is awful’: senior women’s complaints about MoD behaviour,"<p>Edited extracts of women’s recent testimonies about working at the Ministry of Defence</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/16/sixty-women-at-mod-complain-of-widespread-toxic-and-hostile-behaviour"">60 women at MoD complain of widespread ‘toxic’ behaviour</a></li></ul><p>The following are edited extracts from <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/16/sixty-women-at-mod-complain-of-widespread-toxic-and-hostile-behaviour"">a letter that 60 senior civilian women at the UK’s Ministry of Defence sent to their permanent secretary</a>. The letter includes anonymised testimonies in which women have shared their recent experiences of working at the MoD.</p><p>The accounts allege a range of serious incidents and patterns of behaviour, which the women said were “only a sample” of “an extraordinary amount of concerning experiences” they had received.</p><p>I was told by a military officer that there were only two kinds of women in Defence, the bitches, who were effective, and the mumsy ones, who were completely useless, and I would need to decide which I was going to be if I planned to have a career in Defence.”</p><p>I avoid walking through the Pillared Hall [one of the main hallways of the MoD’s headquarters in Whitehall] alone. The groups of men staring is horrible. It’s the same on some of the 4th floor floorplates. They’ve even wolf whistled. The constant objectification and harassment is appalling. Behaviours that are completely unacceptable on public transport, for example, are accepted in pockets of Main Building.”</p><p>In a one-to-one setting in the office during the working day, a senior military officer came on to me. It made me feel shocked, upset, and reduced from what I thought I was seen as by my [exclusively male] seniors … to a woman seen through a lens of ‘attractiveness’ at work … It shattered my confidence and, I hate having to say this, I couldn’t help but question whether it was my fault: what is it about me that made this man think he could do this; am I too friendly at work; am I wearing the wrong clothes. It took me a long time not to feel anxious in his company.”</p><p>I was propositioned by a military officer late at night in a corridor on [an overseas MoD] base when I was leaving my room to go to the bathroom. I felt sick with fear and couldn’t sleep afterwards, not knowing whether he had access to keys and could get into my room.</p><p>The eyes tracking me as I walk through the Pillared Hall is awful. The fact that there are some men in the team [who are] so inappropriate, others warn us about being alone with them on work nights out. The fact that those men are some of the most senior in [my department] and keep getting promoted.</p><p>I am often the only woman in the room and on almost all occasions men comment on what I wear, my fragrance, and if I’m wearing a skirt or dress, they have often remarked, ‘you have legs!’. This started when I first joined the MoD as a junior official. On arriving or introducing myself, I was told that it was lovely I was there to ‘fragrance’ or ‘decorate’ the room and always in front of other meeting attendees. These behaviours always made me feel reduced compared to others in the room. It was intimidating, sometimes held me back from speaking in meetings, and undermined me and my role. It also made me doubt myself and my abilities. I spent a long period of time never wearing skirts or dresses, muting the colours I wore, and trying to be plain so as to blend, rather than stand out; all in the hope that people would take me seriously.</p><p>[When I joined the department], there was an equal mix of men and women on the programme. Most of the men are still at the MoD. I’m the only woman left. Every single woman who has left before me has put their decision to leave down to the culture here … Not a single woman [is] left from a large fast stream year group. It’s a damning indictment, as well as a colossal waste of MoD talent investment.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/16/the-eyes-tracking-me-is-awful-senior-womens-complaints-about-mod-behaviour"">Continue reading...</a>","Thu, 16 Nov 2023 15:37:45 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/16/the-eyes-tracking-me-is-awful-senior-womens-complaints-about-mod-behaviour

Many had thought the supreme court would uphold Rishi Sunak’s appeal on his flagship Rwanda policy. The one thing he thought he might have something to boast about. Or at the very least that the court might deliver a nuanced verdict. One that left the government some room for manoeuvre.</p><p>Lord Reed, the top judge on the five-strong panel, had other ideas. He just about contained a smile. It’s such a perfect day. He was glad he spent it with you. There were no ifs, no buts. The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/law/video/2023/nov/15/supreme-court-sunak-plan-deport-asylum-seekers-rwanda-unlawful-video"">Rwanda plan was a non-starter</a>. Rwanda having a track record of killing refugees had made the court think there was something iffy about the UK deporting its refugees to Rwanda. Funny that. Nor should the UK think it could get round the judgment by leaving the European convention on human rights.

17,The Guardian view on Rishi Sunak’s asylum policy: empty slogans are no substitute for good government | Editorial,"<p>The supreme court has sunk the prime minister’s flagship policy and he is squandering a valuable opportunity to change course</p><p>It is not too late for the government to align UK immigration policy with the principles of international law. It is probably too late for Rishi Sunak to derive any political benefit from a change of direction now that the supreme court has rendered his existing scheme inoperable. He must still make that change in defiance of demands from Conservative MPs to push on faster down the wrong path.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/15/supreme-court-rejects-rishi-sunak-plan-to-deport-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda"" title="""">court’s ruling</a> is unambiguous on the point of law that prevents implementation of the government’s proposed scheme for processing asylum claims in Rwanda. Refugees deported by that mechanism would not have sufficient guarantee against being returned to the places from which they had fled in fear of persecution, torture or death. That protection – the principle of non-refoulement – is a foundational tenet of human rights law and the refugee conventions to which the UK is bound.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

19,"The Rwanda plan is dead in the real world, but will live on in the fantasyland of Tory politics | Martin Kettle","<p>The supreme court judgment was clear. But that won’t stop the party’s nationalist wing believing they can still succeed</p><p>Ever since Brenda Hale stepped down as president of the supreme court in 2020, it has not been difficult to find lawyers who worried that her more judicially conservative successor, Robert Reed, would be anxious to avoid standing up to the UK government in the way that the Hale court did so dramatically over the prorogation of parliament in 2019.</p><p>Those fears now look to have been seriously misjudged, after the Reed court today <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/15/supreme-court-rejects-rishi-sunak-plan-to-deport-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda"">unanimously dismissed</a> the government’s policy of transferring asylum seekers to Rwanda. Lord Reed is a different kind of judicial thinker from Lady Hale. He can certainly argue that the judgment was impeccably conservative in legal terms. But the ruling is in many ways a more consequential and devastating rebuff to UK government and UK politics than even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue"">the Hale judgment</a>.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/15/rwanda-plan-dead-real-world-live-on-fantasyland-tory-politics"">Continue reading...</a>","Wed, 15 Nov 2023 16:54:07 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/15/rwanda-plan-dead-real-world-live-on-fantasyland-tory-politics

Does the UK have the right to place refugees – people who have fled war, persecution, torture or worse – at risk of being sent back to the countries they fled? The judges were clear: no, it does not. Contrary to what you might read in the rightwing press, this isn’t only because of the European convention on human rights or its UK counterpart, the Human Rights Act. The judges stressed that a whole set of international treaties, including the UN Refugee Convention, as well as multiple UK laws on asylum and immigration, prohibit the practice, which is known officially as <a href=""https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/refoulement"">refoulement</a> (the act of forcing a refugee to return to a place from which he or she is seeking asylum).</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/15/rwanda-plan-tatters-defeat-undermines-entire-tory-project"">Continue reading...</a>","Wed, 15 Nov 2023 14:43:36 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/15/rwanda-plan-tatters-defeat-undermines-entire-tory-project

She discusses impostor syndrome, her bond with Boris Johnson – and why she feels like Carrie Johnson’s second mum </p><p>Nadine Dorries never quite felt she belonged around the Cabinet table. Seated between Jacob Rees-Mogg and Scottish secretary Alister Jack, she would joke that all three came from estates but only hers was a council one. Yet privately, the girl who left school at 16 felt intimidated. “I was scared stiff to speak, so I did it in jokes,” she says, over tea at a Kensington hotel. “I did it with scouse humour and that was like my coat of armour.” In her new book The Plot, which claims to identify shadowy forces behind Boris Johnson’s downfall, Dorries writes that when a contact asks to meet at fancy London restaurant the Wolseley, she worries she won’t understand the menu. Seriously? “I’ve never been to many posh restaurants!” she cries. ‘I don’t socialise in London, I socialise in the countryside where I live! But I think it was the person I was meeting at the Wolseley that made me nervous.” She says even the Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti recently gave her a kindly pep talk about overcoming impostor syndrome.</p><p>We meet the morning after <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/13/david-cameron-returns-to-uk-government-as-foreign-secretary"">David Cameron’s surprise return to government</a>, gift-wrapped in a peerage despite his involvement in the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/13/greensill-scandal-david-cameron-cabinet"">Greensill lobbying scandal</a>. Dorries, who famously quit parliament after being denied the peerage for which Johnson nominated her, is incensed. “As long as you’ve been to Eton, someone just has a word with the king and pop, in you go. It doesn’t matter that you’ve lobbied ministers and chancellors and former prime ministers to try and make yourself shedloads of money during the pandemic,” she says, witheringly. “This is all about rehabilitating David. He’s been seven years on the grouse moors now, so he’s obviously a bit bored.” Recently, someone who was shooting with Cameron in Scotland WhatsApped her after her name arose in conversation: her spies are everywhere. “I heard last week from somebody in No 10, who said to me: ‘Oh my effing God, your book has exploded in here, they are going nuts.’”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/15/nadine-dorries-on-cabals-cosmetic-work-and-camerons-peerage-if-youre-an-etonian-someone-just-has-a-word-with-the-king"">Continue reading...</a>","Wed, 15 Nov 2023 16:59:42 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/15/nadine-dorries-on-cabals-cosmetic-work-and-camerons-peerage-if-youre-an-etonian-someone-just-has-a-word-with-the-king
